CCNowPlaying
===================
Post #NowPlaying from Control Center

CCNowPlaying is available free of charge on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.

> I don’t like to do it all the time, but sometimes I’m jamming to a song so hard that I just have to let the world (or at least my own corner of the Internet) know what I’m listening to. For moments like these, CCNowPlaying is a great jailbreak tweak to have in your repertoire. It allows you to quickly send a tweet or a Facebook status update telling your followers what song you’re currently playing. It’s a tweak that integrates directly into Control Center, and features a stock look and feel.
