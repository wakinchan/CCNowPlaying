CCNowPlaying
===================
Post #NowPlaying from Control Center

CCNowPlaying is available free of charge on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.

> For moments like these, CCNowPlaying is a great jailbreak tweak to have in your repertoire. It allows you to quickly send a tweet or a Facebook status update telling your followers what song you’re currently playing. It’s a tweak that integrates directly into Control Center, and features a stock look and feel.
